The VerCoI approach, a static spec-to-code verification methodology designed to address the challenges of managing and implementing XACML-based systems. The VerCoI approach bridges the gap between access control rule specifications and source code implementation to provide logical consistency and faithful enforcement of CoI policies. Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of the VerCoI approach, which comprises three key components:


_1:_ Access Control Rules to XACML Transformation: Automatically converts access control rules from textual descriptions into XACML policy specifications using a converter component, enabling precise and formal representation of policies.


_2:_ Consistency Verification: Performs static analysis on the generated XACML policies to detect potential conflicts and inconsistencies within the policy sets, ensuring logical soundness before proceeding to system implementation.


_3:_ Spec-to-Code Compliance Verification: Performs static analysis of the systemâ€™s source code to ensure that it correctly enforces the CoI policies defined in the verified XACML specifications, thus guaranteeing policy compliance and preventing unauthorized access.
